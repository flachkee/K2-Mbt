        <p class="article-content">
          The K2 Black Panther (Hangul: K2 '흑표'; Hanja: K2 '黑豹') is a
          next-generation South Korean main battle tank designed by the Agency
          for Defense Development and manufactured by Hyundai Rotem. Developed
          as a modern replacement for most of the remaining M48 Patton tanks
          currently fielded by the South Korean military, the K2 Black Panther
          combines an auto-loaded 120 mm main gun, advanced composite armor,
          along with soft and hard-kill active protection systems. </br> Mass
          production commenced in 2013 and the first K2s were deployed with the
          armed forces in June 2014. The K2 costs over US$8.5 million per unit,
          making it one of the most expensive main battle tanks in service, of
          any nation.</p>

          tank rounds, fired from L55 guns. The Black Panther tank is also completed with an active protection system
          and countermeasures system. The tank is also completed with an <span><b class="tooltip"

          protection system. Protection of the K2 is broadly similar to the M1A2 Abrams MBT considering that the K2 is
          significantly lighter. It is claimed that the K2 is superior to the M1A2 Abrams.</p>

        <p class="article-content">The Black Panther is armed with a Rheinmetall 120 mm/L55 smoothbore gun. This gun is
          license-produced in South Korea. The K2 is completed with an automatic loader. This MBT has a maximum rate of
          fire in 15 rounds per minute. It is worth mentioning that autoloader's is similar to that, used on the French
          Leclerc main battle tank. A total of 16 rounds are stored in the autoloader. Remaining 24 rounds are stored
          inside the hull.</p>

          It also has a very advanced fire control system, allowing to track and engage not only the main battle tanks,
          but low-flying helicopters as well. Maximum effective range of fire is up to 10 kilometers. Furthermore its
          fire control system can spot, track and fire automatically at visible vehicle-size targets without needing any
          input from a human operator.
          <br /><br />The 120 mm gun can fire variety of munitions. It is compatible with all standard NATO tank rounds.
          It is also capable of firing the new KSTAM (Korean Smart Top-Attack Munition) rounds. These are smart
          target-activated fire-and-forget projectiles, but shouldn't be confused with anti-tank guided missiles. The
          KSTAM has its own guidancesystem, aided by four stabilizing fins. At the final stage a parachute will deploy
          to slow its fall and accurately engage target. Such principle is broadly similar tomortar-launched anti-tank
          munitions. Furthermore the K-2 tank can fire KSTAM munitions from behind the cover. The KSTAM has a maximum
          effective range of 8 kilometers.

        <p class="article-content">Secondary armament consists of coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun and K6 12.7 mm heavy
          machine gun,
          mounted on top of the roof. Both of these machine gun have a very respectableammunition load (12 000 x 7.62 mm
          and 3 200 x 12.7 mm). Furthermore the K6 heavy machine gun has an automatic system, that identifies friend
          from
          a foe.<br /><br />This main battle tank has a crew of three, including commander, gunner and driver. Other
          features of the K2 tank include digital battlefield management system and navigation system for rapid
          coordination. The K2 can rapidly report combat situation, thus increasing situational awareness of friendly
          forces.</p>

        <p class="article-content">There is also an auxiliary gas-turbine power unit, developing 400 horsepower. It
          powers onboard systems when the main engine is turned off. The K2 Black Panther has a state-of-the-art
          semi-active hydropneumatic suspension. Every boogie wheel can be individually controlled, allowing this MBT to
          "sit", "stand", "kneel" or to "lean" in any direction. This feature gives tank a number of advantages,
          furthermore it is claimed that such suspension system is easier to maintain, comparing with traditional one.
          The Black Panther tank is fitted with a deep wading kit. It enables vehicle to cross rivers and other water
          obstacles up to 4.2 meters deep. Previous K1 and K1A1 MBTs lacked this feature. Interestingly South Korea
          tested large engine mufflers on this tank. Two mufflers were attached to the rear of the hull in order to
          reduce the engine noise.</p>
